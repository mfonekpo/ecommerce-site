# A webscraping-Project

- This project was aimed at exctracting laptop catalogue on a demo website ("https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/static").
- The tool used to achive this was Selenium. The choice of this tool was because of the ability to be able to navigate the website and scrape data off of every page automatically. unlike beautiful soup, this gives me more flexiblity, thereby making automation easy.
- There are 20 pages in the website, 6 items per page. making it a total of 120 items.


## The items information scraped from the website is as follows:
- **Product Name**
- **Product Description**
- **Price of Product**
- **Number of Reviews**
- **Product Url.**

The extracted data was then stored in a csv format for further use. Any Analystical technique can be carried out on this file, but that is not the scope of this project. Thank you
